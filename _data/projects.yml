# Arabic OCR CNN
- project: Arabic OCR CNN
  role: sole contributer
  duration: 2018
  url: "https://github.com/KaysData/Arabic-Handwritten-Character-Classification-CNN"
  description: Classified Arabic handwritten character images with 93% accuracy. Used two convolutional layers each with their own pooling layer. Written in Tensorflow using Jupyter Notebook on Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2.

# Performance Comparison
- project: Performance Comparison of Three Algorithms
  role: sole contributer
  duration: 2017
  url: "https://github.com/KaysData/Performance-Comparison"
  description: Compared performance of SVM (linear and RBF), Decision trees, and K-nearest neighbors. Processed three datasets from the UC Irvine ML repository (wine production location estimation, wine quality classification, and breast cancer estimation). Written in python using NumPy and scikit-learn. Utilized cross-validation for all analysis.
  
# Markov Chord Progression Generator
- project: Markov Chord Progression Generator
  role: sole contributer
  duration: 2019
  url: "https://github.com/KaysData/Markov-Chord-Progression-Generator"
  description: Creates and plays new chord progressions using a Markov chain. The dataset was built from listings of common  progressions. It is written in python using pyaudio for sound generation.
